      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Yellowstone Chamber of Commerce is in a rural county that consists of
          mostly small towns established within or surrounding a well-beloved
          national park. Most residents are either retirees or people who make
          their living on ranching, farming, or boutique shops that serve the
          numerous patrons who travel from around the world to see the natural
          beauty of the park. The site provides information that facilitates
          positive interactions between citizens and visitors alike. We seek to
          make the visitors stay so agreeable that, not only do they return year
          after year, but they also encourage others back home to become regular
          attendees as well. This constant economic influx helps to keep the
          community a thriving and inviting place.

        <h3>Scott Billings</h3>
        <p>Persona: Former CFO</p>
        <p>Fictional Name: Scott Billings</p>
        <p>Job title/major responsibilities: Former CFO, retired</p>

        <p>
          Environment: Scott worked in a fast-paced corporate environment for 37
          years. He came to Yellowstone for a two-week retreat and fell in love
          with its relaxed small-town charm. Scott decided to retire early in
          order to come and live in Yellowstone as a full-time resident. After
          three years, he still loved the community, but was looking for
          something more to keep himself engaged. He purchased a parcel of land
          and the rights to sell from several herds of bison and deer that graze
          on his land. As his business continues to grow, he has plans to branch
          out and distribute his “wild beef” nationwide.
