        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <h4>Green Chef</h4>

          Green Chef's website is a great example of visual hierarchy.
          Immediately, it draws your eye to the delicious meal that is on
          display at the center of the page. After taking in the goods, we then
          notice the headline, followed by the button which is our call to
          action, then the other descriptors, and finally the menu with the logo
          and another call to action at the top of the screen. If we take it all
          in, we can infer that Green Chef is a meal kit subscription service
          which offers a variety of meal plans for people with all types of
          dietary needs.

        <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
        <h4>Nintendo</h4>
        <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">nintendo.com</a>
        <picture>
          <img
            src="images/nintendo-rsz25.png"
            alt="A screen capture of the Nintendo mobile website."
          />

        <p>
          Essentially, Fitt's law state's that the time required to move to a
          target is determined by the ratio between the distance to the target
          and the size of the target. The larger an object is, the closer it is.
          In terms of a website, larger elements are closer to the user than
          smaller ones; therefore, it makes sense that you would want to make
          the largest elements the ones that are used most often. On Nintendo's
          site we see Fitt's law in action. While there are several elements on
          screen, the ones that are used more often, the purchase and search
          buttons, are set apart from the rest by their greater size and bolder
          color.

        <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
        <h4 id="nch-h4">NCH Software</h4>
        <a href="https://www.nchsoftware.com/" target="_blank"
          >nchsoftware.com</a
        >

          <img
            id="nch-img"
            src="images/nchsoft-rsz25.png"

        <p>
          Proximity is a way of demonstrating how the mind naturally categorizes
          objects based upon their distance from each other. When objects are
          close together, we assume that they are part of the same group. When
          they are far apart, we do not associate them with each other. We see
          the principle of proximity on the NCH Software website. At first, it
          almost appears cluttered; however, the number of items being displayed
          on such a small screen shows how efficient this layout is at
          delineating the various groups of the site. It is remarkable how much
          is on display while still preserving the white space around each group
          - a great use of proximity.
